# tests/performance — live-service tests & eval harnesses

Code here hits **real external services** (arXiv, OpenAlex, Ollama, etc.)
and measures end-to-end behaviour. Everything here is excluded from CI
(`.github/workflows/docker-tests.yml` runs `-m 'not integration'` for
pytest, and the non-`test_*.py` eval scripts aren't collected by
pytest at all).

## Layout

```
tests/performance/
├── _shared/                   — general pipeline harnesses, not tied to one subsystem
│   ├── run_full_search.py     — thin CLI around quick_summary(); --engine / --model flags
│   └── build_eval_dataset.py  — cross-product runner (query × engine × model) over run_full_search.py
├── relevance_filter/          — LLM-as-judge relevance filter (live arXiv + Ollama)
│   ├── test_live.py           — pytest live arXiv + Ollama test (integration + requires_llm + slow)
│   ├── eval_prompt.py         — human-judgment harness: vary prompt, same judge, same arXiv
│   └── eval_models.py         — human-judgment harness: vary judge, same prompt, same arXiv
├── strategies/                — decomposition / iterative-reasoning strategies (live LLM + meta_search)
│   └── compare_strategies_visual.py — human-judgment harness: cross-strategy timeline plots
├── content_fetcher/           — HTML extraction quality across 200+ real URLs (live network)
├── search_engines/            — new-adapter integration against live APIs (Open Library, Zenodo, etc.)
├── mcp/                       — MCP client concurrency (real subprocess echo server)
├── database/                  — encrypted-DB backwards-compat (installs previous PyPI release)
└── api_auth/                  — authenticated research API validation (requires running server + Puppeteer)
```

**When you add performance tests / harnesses for a new subsystem** (e.g.
embeddings, rate limiting, search-engine latency), create a new sibling
folder alongside `relevance_filter/`. Put anything that's genuinely
subsystem-agnostic in `_shared/`.

## Running the pytest tests

```
LDR_TESTING_WITH_MOCKS=false \
LDR_TEST_OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434 \
LDR_TEST_OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3.5:9b \
pdm run pytest tests/performance/ -v -s -m integration
```

`LDR_TESTING_WITH_MOCKS=false` is required — `tests/conftest.py` defaults
it to `true` which auto-skips anything tagged `requires_llm`.

Pytest tests should:
- carry `@pytest.mark.integration` (and usually `@pytest.mark.requires_llm`
  and `@pytest.mark.slow`) so they stay out of CI
- skip cleanly when the required external service is unreachable rather
  than fail
- print their KEPT/REMOVED decisions (or equivalent detail) with `print()`
  — run with `-s` to see them — so humans reviewing output can judge
  quality, not just pass/fail

## Running the eval harnesses

The `eval_*.py`, `run_*.py`, `build_*.py` scripts are human-judgment
tools — success signal is a human reading the output, not a pass/fail
assertion. They're runnable as plain Python:

```
# Swap between prompt variants against the same live arXiv results
pdm run python tests/performance/relevance_filter/eval_prompt.py

# Swap between judge LLMs, same prompt
pdm run python tests/performance/relevance_filter/eval_models.py

# One-shot end-to-end report
pdm run python tests/performance/_shared/run_full_search.py \
    --query "LLM interpretability latest research" --engine arxiv

# Cross-product dataset build
pdm run python tests/performance/_shared/build_eval_dataset.py
```
